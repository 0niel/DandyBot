# DandyBot

–ê simple programming game. You write Python scripts to control your bot in a roguelike (or [Dandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandy_(video_game))-like) world. The goal is to collect as much gold as possible in the presence of other bots.

The game uses only the Python standard library. Graphics assets are from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles-supplemental).
